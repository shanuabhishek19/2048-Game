# 2048-Game
2048 is a web-based, grid-based puzzle game that can be developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game consists of a 4x4 grid of cells that display numbers, starting with two randomly placed tiles of value 2 or 4. The player can move the tiles left, right, up, or down by sliding them in the desired direction. When two tiles of the same number touch, they merge into a single tile with a value equal to the sum of their values. The game continues until the player reaches the goal of creating a tile with the value 2048 or until there are no more possible moves left on the grid.

To implement the game logic, the developer must track the state of the grid and update it accordingly when the player makes a move. A scoring system can also be implemented to track the player's progress. To ensure a smooth user experience, animations can be added when tiles merge and move. Additionally, the game can be made responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

The game can be further enhanced with features such as a high-score system, a restart button, and different difficulty levels. These additional features will require additional code to be written to implement them.
